# Creating Node.js modules
Node.js modules are a type of package that can be published to npm. This tutorial was created from [Docs NPMjs.com: creating nodejs modules](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-node-js-modules)

1. Create a package.json file
2. Create the main file that will be loaded when your module is required by another application
3. Log in with `npm login`
4. Publish your package to npm: To publish your private package to the npm registry run `npm publish`
5. To see your private package page, visit `https://npmjs.com/package/*package-name`, replacing **package-name** with the name of your package. Private packages will say private below the package name on the npm website.
